# No _redirects file on purpose. Cloudflare Pages' native routing already does
# exactly what we need, and a hand-rolled _redirects here caused an
# ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS loop on /admin:
#   * Pages serves admin.html at the clean URL /admin and 308-redirects
#     /admin.html -> /admin. An explicit "/admin /admin.html 200" proxy fought
#     that auto-redirect (/admin -> /admin.html -> 308 /admin -> ... forever).
#   * A "/* /index.html 200" SPA proxy self-loops too (Pages strips /index -> /
#     -> matches /* again); modern wrangler flags it as an infinite loop.
# Instead we rely on Pages' documented defaults: route matching serves
# admin.html at /admin and real assets at /static/*, while the built-in SPA
# fallback (active because there is no top-level 404.html) serves index.html for
# unmatched client routes (/create-run, /run/<id>, ...).
